# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose/Reason
#### The purpose of this Data Analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the key metrics involved for the ride-sharing data by city type, and by creating a multi-line graph that shows the total fares of each week by each city type. In addition, this will include a written report on the results of the new analysis and future recommendations. I analyzed the data by reviewing the information of each City and City Type and then created a new dataframe by City Type and got the Total Number of Drivers, Total Rides, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver, for each City Type of Urban, Suburban and Rural. By reviewing the dataframe below, the information tells us that the Urban City Type had the most amount of drivers, rides and total fares on the flip side; Rural City Type had the least amount of drivers, rides and total fares. In the Total Fare by City Type graph, the Urban line (yellow) shows the highest sum of fares, Rural line (blue) shows the least sum of fares, which reflects what we observed earlier in the dataframe.

#### I came across issues 




    What challenges or difficulties did you encounter? If none, then briefly explain what challenges or difficulties may be encountered and how to avoid them using technical analysis.
    Explain how you overcame any challenges or difficulties, and include what technical analysis you use to overcome the challenges or difficulties.



#### I would recommend that 


    Based on the data from the different city types, what recommendations would you give the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types?
    Provide two additional analyses you could do to gain more insight into the data, like using other datasets.
    What technical steps would you take to perform the additional analyses?
